  "We split this up into a authentication web server that teams can spin up. In order to spin it up they would need to provide a mongo uri, secret key, and url to deploy to. This deploys an API that they can use for authentication on the server side. In addition, from the client side we want to build higher order components that would validate the information and make the necessary requests. This should simplify a lot of the work on the frontend to integrate it in to their current systems. It would also prevent teams from having to do work that would be repetitive while still allowing them to style the pages appropriately.";

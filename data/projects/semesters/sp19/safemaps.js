  "Settling onto a sprawling campus of over 354 University buildings, 12,454 international students, 33,673 undergraduates can be an overwhelming experience for UIUC students. Currently, the University offers introductory programs including Freshmen and International Student Orientation programs that gives students a preview of available safety & wellness resources. However, after those introductory programs conclude, there is little guidance or follow-up on where and how to navigate these safety resources. This sense of being overwhelmed is particularly heightened when students are in transit — traveling around at night, walking in areas they have not been to before, etc";

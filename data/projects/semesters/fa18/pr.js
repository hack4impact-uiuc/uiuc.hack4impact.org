/* Product Details and Solution */

  "Philadelphia READS provides out-of-school programs to increase literacy rates among grade-school students. One of these programs is the yearly Reading Olympics. Teams of students read books from a specified book list and prepare to answer questions about the books. One drawback is that these programs are all tied to in-person interactions and Philadelphia READS does not have resources for students while they are at home or on the go.";

const solution =
  "We worked with Philadelphia READs and their professionals to develop a tablet-friendly web application that allows students to prepare for the Reading Olympics, and provides helpful information for parents on how to be involved in their children's learning";

After getting accepted into iVenture Accelerator and doing summer research, Premika and Kendall decided to tackle the issue of sexual assault. CTTC’s goal is to increase reporting and eventually increase prosecution through a rape kit tracking system. Currently Premika and Kendall are working on customer research";
